This prescription was the FIRST of five, issued by the Treasury Department during the Prohibition. The doc had beautiful penmanship and &quot;1920&quot; prescriptions for &quot;whiskey&quot; are quite rare! Also, the majority of scripts were for frumenti, so the whiskey scripts are not as prevalent.\n\nIt is the ONLY prescription in which, &quot;His street and No.&quot; was printed below the address line, while just as many women were having liquor prescriptions filled. Please see photos!\n\nFrom the days of Al Capone, speakeasies and moonshine, this was the only legal way to drink liquor in the US!\n\nThe whiskey was prescribed for H. E. Stephenson, by Dr. Willis G. Jones, on November 16, 1920, and was stamped (filling date...oops) November 15, 1920, by Yunker-Lierman Drug Store in Sedalia, MO. It was issued by the Treasury Department and measures 6&quot; x 3.5&quot;.\n\nThe prescription has some bends, light edge wear and age toning (not white\/looks like it&#39;s from 1920), otherwise, condition is excellent...a great, historic 1920 Prohibition script...a personal all-time favorite!\n\nThis is a FANTASTIC piece of history and would be great to display in a pharmacy, speakeasy, distillery, doctor&#39;s office, museum, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions, please feel free to email and thank you for your interest!\n\nPleased to combine shipping with other Prohibition Prescriptions, Liquor Licenses, Opium Forms & Pharmacy Labels. As always, many thanks to my regular customers for your continued patronage! :)\n\nAll items ship within 24 hours and I will contact you when I receive notification of any purchase, thank you! :)","creation_tsz":1475883910,"ending_tsz":1486514710,"original_creation_tsz":1449679639,"last_modified_tsz":1475883910,"price":"75.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["medicine","distillery","doctor","pharmacist","drug store","nurse","pharmacy","whiskey","prohibition","medicinal","rare whiskey","rare prescription","1920 whiskey"],"category_path":["Paper Goods","Scrapbooking","Ephemera"],"category_path_ids":[69150367,68889914,68907410],"materials":["treasury department paper"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1475848217,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/259878417\/original-rare-1920-stephenson?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":88,"num_favorers":5,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":1,"who_made":"someone_else","is_supply":"false","when_made":"1920s","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":"thanksgiving","style":null,"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2779,"taxonomy_path":["Paper & Party Supplies","Paper","Paper Ephemera"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":876008846,"hex_code":"E6D5BB","red":230,"green":213,"blue":187,"hue":36,"saturation":18,"brightness":90,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1449679639,"listing_id":259878417,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/6057601\/il_75x75.876008846_47qn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/6057601\/il_170x135.876008846_47qn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/6057601\/il_570xN.876008846_47qn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/124\/0\/6057601\/il_fullxfull.876008846_47qn.jpg","full_height":884,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":876008894,"hex_code":"DECDB4","red":222,"green":205,"blue":180,"hue":36,"saturation":18,"brightness":87,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1449679639,"listing_id":259878417,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/6057601\/il_75x75.876008894_zt7f.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/6057601\/il_170x135.876008894_zt7f.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/6057601\/il_570xN.876008894_zt7f.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/108\/0\/6057601\/il_fullxfull.876008894_zt7f.jpg","full_height":830,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":875779561,"hex_code":"E6D5BB","red":230,"green":213,"blue":187,"hue":36,"saturation":18,"brightness":90,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1449679639,"listing_id":259878417,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/6057601\/il_75x75.875779561_12y8.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/6057601\/il_170x135.875779561_12y8.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/6057601\/il_570xN.875779561_12y8.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/6057601\/il_fullxfull.875779561_12y8.jpg","full_height":884,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6057601,"shop_name":"ProhibitionWhiskey","user_id":11371431,"creation_tsz":1287322223,"title":"Prohibition Whiskey Prescriptions Opium Moonshine Forms","announcement":"Welcome, please have a sip of whiskey, relax and enjoy a fine selection of US Government issued Prohibition prescriptions, Opium narcotic forms and Moonshine liquor dealer tax stamps.

Payment is required before the ring(s) will be sent back. \n\nIf you have a problem, please contact me through Etsy conversations.","policy_additional":"RING SIZE\n\nI guarantee that your order will be made to the exact size and width you specify. If I make an error and send you the wrong size, I will create a new ring in the correct size specified in your original order and pay any postage both ways. \n\nIt is very important to order the correct size, our rings are all made to order and even though I might be able to increase the ring by 1\/4 size this is not guaranteed.\n\nI recommend checking your size at a jewelry store, a couple if possible. Since narrow and wide rings will fit differently have your finger sized with a ring the width you plan to order. You may want to be sized more than once to ensure accuracy. Most jewelers use the bottom or leading edge of the ring to determine the size, some use the middle of the ring. We measure where the metal meets the mandrel on the leading edge. The frustrating part is that there are also slight variances between ring mandrels, that is the reason we also measure each ring with a digital caliper to the exact size.\n\nPlease do not use string to measure your ring size.\n\nRING CARE\n\nMy rings are made to last a lifetime, all rings are given a clear durable multi step finish to ensure the ring remains structurally sound and beautiful. Regular hand washing is not a problem, prolonged contact with water such as swimming should not damage the ring. Solvents could and most likely will damage the ring, If you work in an environment where solvents are used or in the medical field where your hands come in contact with sanitizers we suggest you not wear your ring.\n\nAll rings require minimal care on the part of the wearer, simply use the polishing cloth we provide on a regular basis and apply a coat of Carnauba wax every 6 months. \n\nI have spent years working with different finishes and I believe I have found the best finish for wood inlay rings. Under normal usage the finish on my rings will last years, yes I have done all the tests the other ring makers perform, Water test, dishwasher test, dryer test, etc. But I also have gone further by placing my wood inlay rings in a rock tumbler with a variety of coins which includes pennies, dimes, nickels, quarters and half dollars. I tested the ring by running the tumbler for a couple of hours and the result showed no damage to the finish on the ring. \n\nI do recommend removing your ring before washing hands, swimming or showering using hand sanitizers or handling chemicals but I would recommend this no matter what type of ring you wear . \n\nDo not soak wood inlay rings in silver jewelry cleaner this could remove the finish and damage the ring. If you need to clean the sterling silver bands use the polishing cloth I provide you and simply wipe the silver band. The polishing cloth works great on all metals and wood.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1467496566,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SimpleJewelzDesigns?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/128\/0\/11595676\/iusb_760x100.21803655_gt7n.jpg","num_favorers":79,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/113\/0\/11595676\/isla_fullxfull.18099224_3yeuurku.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":236673262,"state":"active","user_id":40336509,"category_id":68887546,"title":"Whiskey Candle, Soy Candle, Scented Candle, Long Distance Boyfriend Gift Idea, Dad Birthday Gift for Dad, Gifts for Boyfriend","description":"This whiskey soy candle has the distinguished aroma reminiscent of honey whiskey and vanilla!\n\nSIZE:\n\nEach scented candle tin has approximately 4 fluid ounces of soy wax and weighs about 5 ounces. Tins are 2&quot; tall and 2 1\/2&quot; in diameter. Each candle is carefully hand-poured in small batches in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nBURN TIME & USE:\n\nEach candle tin has a burn time of up to 32 hours and is comprised of 100% soy wax with cotton wicks, making each one clean burning! My soy candles are eco-friendly and made with GMO free soy beans. Soy candles burn cleaner with less soot and burn longer than traditional paraffin candles. Soy candles are also very easy to clean up with soap and water if spilled. The fragrance oils that I use in my candles are also all phthalate free! The candle tins may be cleaned out and either recycled or reused after the candle has completely burned out. \n\nTo maximize the life of your candles, keep wicks trimmed to 1\/4 inch. Burn 3-4 hours per use. The fragrance of the candle is released when the wax is melted and pools across the surface of the candle. Please keep away from children and pets.\n\n\nFAQ: &quot;ARE YOUR CANDLES STRONGLY SCENTED?&quot;\n\nEach floor plan for each home produces different results. Most get GREAT results with 1 candle (in medium 15 x 15 ft. to smaller rooms), while others need 2 candles. Understand that it is more difficult to fill open floor plan homes since the scent has to continue to travel and as the scent spreads over large areas it will get less intense.

However, the candle&#39;s fragrance fills the room way before the candle has reached the full melt pool.\r\n\r\nWhat are your candle burn times? \r\n4 oz Candle Tins: up to 32 Hours\r\n4 oz Tropical Bar Jar Candles: up to 32 Hours\r\nCandle Pies: up to 50 Hours\r\n\r\nWhat are your candle sizes?\r\nMy candle tins have approximately 4 fluid ounces of soy wax and weigh about 5 ounces. Tins are 2&quot; tall and 2 1\/2&quot; in diameter.\r\n\r\nMy bakery candle pies are approximately 8 fluid ounces of soy wax and weigh about 10 ounces. Each pie is 1 1\/2&quot; tall and 5&quot; in diameter.\r\n\r\nWhat type of wax and wicks do you use?  \r\nI use soy wax with cotton wicks making my candles natural burning candles.  I have a few candles pies topped with gel wax for a longer burning time and a glazed finish; however, they are indicated as such under the corresponding item.\r\n\r\nDoes the scent throw vary for each home?  \r\nEach floor plan for each home produce different results. Most get great results with 1 candle (in medium-15 x 15 ft. to smaller rooms), some need 2 candles. Understand it is more difficult to fill open floor plan homes since the scent has to continue to travel and as the scent spreads over large areas it will get less intense. An average room with walls will keep the scent inside and of course create a more intense strong scent.\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE ORDERS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME.
